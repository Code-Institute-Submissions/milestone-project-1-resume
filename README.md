# Milestone Project 1- Resume

<p>I created this resume website as a 4 page site with clickable links on each page that allow you to click through the entire web page. I also decided to include a page with a CV pdf file. </p>
<p>This website is aimed at employers, who through using the website, will be able to view any projects that I have worked on. I have decided that this would be my first 
milestone project as it would be a great first part of my online portfolio. I will use this website to host any future projects, by simply adding links, to my portfolio section in the 'My Skills' page. 
This will allow me to continually update my site with any new work I have completed as I progess through my web development course at Code Institute. I will also update my skills section as I progress through out the 
course, in order to showcase my knowledge of different languages, technologies and frameworks used throughout web development. I will use this website as an online resume that I will supply as a part 
of my application to any junior web developer roles. I have included personal information, social media links, as well as some about me information, which includes my education, work experience, and future plans.
I also included a form, which visitors can use to get in touch, if they are interested. I believe this project will be something I will continue to work on and it is a great staring pont in my full 
stack developmet portfolio.</p>
